# Document Classification leveraging POS tagging

### The goal of the project:
The project concept is to process an input text with part of speech tags. Having all the words of texts labled, we based on the pre-trained classifier determine the country of origin of this text (weather it is from China, USA, Italy or Germany).

### Demo:
To see how it works, run:
```bash
python3 my_app.py
```
Then insert a text (you can take any text from `./data/articles_example`), press 'Detect country of origin' button and see to which country it belongs.
